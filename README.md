# Analyzing-Thankgiving-Dinner
In this project we tend to answer few questions as mentioned below based on the survey results:
 1) What main dishes people tend to eat during Thanksgiving dinner
 2) How many people eat one of these three pies (apple, pumpkin, and pecan) for Thanksgiving dinner
 3) Based on the family income, how many families tend to celebrate Thankgiving either with their family, or locally, 
 or fly outside?
 4) Which age group tend to celebrate Thankgiving locally with their friends?
